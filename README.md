# Give Theme Project

*Currently just the TPT theme*

This project is a bastardisation of the Bootswatch theme project. Extracted only the bits needed to sit ontop of the
core bootstrap SASS dependancy.

Install dependancies with `npm install` then `bower install`.

Run the local server with `grunt server` which in turn fires up the `grunt watch` task.
